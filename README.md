A node-based graphing calculator capable of displaying polynomial and trigonometric functions.

This project was completed for [Advanced Java (Programming Fundamentals III)](https://www1.dcccd.edu/catalog/courseDescriptions/awardCourseDetail.cfm?loc=econ&course=COSC&number=2436).

If you're in that course or related course right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
